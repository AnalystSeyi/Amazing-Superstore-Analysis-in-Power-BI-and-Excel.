# Amazing-Superstore-Analysis-in-Power-BI-and-Excel.

This task was assigned on Power BI, and I went further to analyze it on Excel so as to showcase competency.

After the presentation of the analysis on Power BI was further assigned a QA task.

#### I was Assigned the Task of QA Test on SQL

Write SQL queries and create a test document to QA the DASHBOARD developed in Power BI software.

1. Functional Validation: Test each feature as per the requirement. To verify all the filters and action filters on the report work as per the requirement

2. Data Validation: Check the accuracy and quality of the data to match the value in the Power BI report with SQL queries.

3. Test Document: Create a test document that will contain the screenshots and queries used to test the reports.
